# LightGBM
LightGBM Binary Classifier using Higgs boson dataset.
Higgs Boson Dataset, source - UCI - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/280/higgs  
This is a classification problem to distinguish between a signal process which produces Higgs bosons and a background process which does not.  
[In simple terms identifying if that's a higgs boson particle or just a random background noise]

In this problem statement, we used LightGBM with RandomizedSearchCV hyperparamter tuning to build a binary classification.
